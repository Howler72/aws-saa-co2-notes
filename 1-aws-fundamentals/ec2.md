EC2 Instance Types
 
 On Demand Instances
 
  • Pay for compute capacity that is used by the hour and minute.  No long term committments or up front payments.
  
  • Users that prefer the low cost and flexibility of Amazon EC2 without any up-front payment or longterm commitment
  
  • Applications with short-term, spiky, or unpredictable workloads that cannot be interrupted
  
  • Applications being developed or tested on Amazon EC2 for the first time
  
Spot Instances —Spot Instances are available at up to a 90% discount compared to On-Demand
  prices and let you take advantage of unused Amazon EC2 capacity in the AWS Cloud. You can
  significantly reduce the cost of running your applications, grow your application’s compute capacity
  and throughput for the same budget, and enable new types of cloud computing applications. Spot
  instances are recommended for:
    • Applications that have flexible start and end times
    
    • Applications that are only feasible at very low compute prices
    
    • Users with urgent computing needs for large amounts of additional capacity
