EC2 Instance Types
 
 On Demand Instances
 
  • Pay for compute capacity that is used by the hour and minute.  No long term committments or up front payments.
  
  • Users that prefer the low cost and flexibility of Amazon EC2 without any up-front payment or longterm commitment
  
  • Applications with short-term, spiky, or unpredictable workloads that cannot be interrupted
  
  • Applications being developed or tested on Amazon EC2 for the first time
  
Spot Instances —Spot Instances are available at up to a 90% discount compared to On-Demand
  prices and let you take advantage of unused Amazon EC2 capacity in the AWS Cloud. You can
  significantly reduce the cost of running your applications, grow your application’s compute capacity
  and throughput for the same budget, and enable new types of cloud computing applications. Spot
  instances are recommended for:
  
    • Applications that have flexible start and end times
    
    • Applications that are only feasible at very low compute prices
    
    • Users with urgent computing needs for large amounts of additional capacity
    
   
Reserved Instances—Reserved Instances provide you with a significant discount (up to 72%)
compared to On-Demand instance pricing. You have the flexibility to change families, operating
system types, and tenancies while benefitting from Reserved Instance pricing when you use
Convertible Reserved Instances.

Savings Plans—Savings Plans are a flexible pricing model that offer low prices on EC2 and Fargate
usage, in exchange for a commitment to a consistent amount of usage (measured in $/hour) for a 1 or
3 year term.

Dedicated Hosts—A Dedicated Host is a physical EC2 server dedicated for your use. Dedicated Hosts
can help you reduce costs by allowing you to use your existing server-bound software licenses,
including Windows Server, SQL Server, and SUSE Linux Enterprise Server (subject to your license
terms), and can also help you meet compliance requirements.
