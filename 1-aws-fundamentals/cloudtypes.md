Public vs Private vs Hybrid vs Multi

    Public Cloud = Using 1 public cloud (AWS, AZURE)
  
    Private Cloud = Using on-premises *real* cloud
  
    Multi Cloud = Using more than 1 public cloud
  
    Hybrid Cloud = Using public and private clouds
  
    Hybrid Cloud = Is NOT public cloud + Legacy on-premises
